# Oral Assessments: Building a Community of Statistical Thinkers and Speakers

## Abstract
<!-- (150 words) -->

Oral assessments provide educators with a wealth of information about student understanding. Rather than deciphering a static written response, oral 
assessments allow instructors to probe student understanding, providing a 
more complete picture of their overall understanding. However, the time and 
energy required to incorporate oral assessments in the classroom may cause many 
educators to shy away. In this session, we will describe two ways in which 
oral exams can be incorporated into the statistics classroom. We will outline 
the necessary considerations when designing and implementing these assessments, 
and reflections from our experiences. Throughout the session participants will 
apply the discussions to an assessment setting of their choice, leaving with an 
outline for implementing their assessment. 

## Goals
<!-- (Describe what you would like participants to take away from your session) -->

In our session, we have two main goals, (1) to breakdown the barriers for 
instructors interested in incorporating oral exams in the classroom, and (2) 
to facilitate instructors designing oral assessments for a specific course. 

The presentations during this session will provide two possible methods for 
incorporating oral assessments in the classroom, one as a follow-up to 
homework assignment(s) and the other as midterm and/or final exams. During these
presentations, we will describe the components that are instrumental to 
designing oral assessments (e.g. design, facilitation, grading), describe 
how we approached each component, and recommendations we would make. 

There will be moments for reflection throughout each presentation. 
Attendees will be given opportunities to consider how they would apply each 
component to design an oral assessment for their course. Following the
presentations, the session will combine these design components into a
cohesive oral assessment. Participants will work in pairs (or groups) to give
feedback on their assessment designs. 


## Connection to Theme
<!-- (Describe how your proposal relates to the conference theme “Expanding Opportunities”) -->

Oral assessments provide an alternative method for students to demonstrate their
understanding. Outside of the confines of written responses, students can
articulate their understanding in a way that is genuine to them. We believe 
this flexibility promotes equity and increases student achievement. Moreover, 
when paired with a classroom emphasizing a growth mindset and student's 
mastery of the material, these assessments increase student engagement and 
participation. 


## Engagement
<!-- (Describe how your 75-minute session will be structured to build interaction and engagement) -->

Activities will be interspersed throughout the session's presentations. These
activities will walk participants through the necessary stages in designing oral 
assessments. These activities will be facilitated through breakout rooms, so 
participants can connect and engage with fellow attendees. Additionally, the
session will conclude with participants assembling each component of their
assessment into a cohesive set and receiving feedback from their partners.  


## Technology
<!-- (Describe any additional technology that presenters will use): -->

No technology other than Zoom will be necessary.
