# Questions to consider, pt. 1

- Where does your oral assessment fit into your overall assessment plan?

  - HW?  Quiz?  Exam?  Project?

--

- What content will you assess?

  - Individual concepts?  Big picture?  Applications?

--

- What format will you use?

  - Time?  Zoom or in-person?  R?  Whiteboard?

--

- What questions will you ask?

  - Fixed set for each student?  Pick from a list?  Free flowing conversation?

---

# Questions to consider, pt. 2

- How will you help students prepare?

  - Practice oral assessments?  Sample questions?  Discussion groups?
  
--

- How will you relieve student anxiety?

  - Friendly chit-chat?  Let them pick first question to answer?  Let them know pauses and (initial) wrong answers are okay?

--

- How will you assess student performance?

  - Scoring rubric?  Individualized feedback?
